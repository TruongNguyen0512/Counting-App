# Sheet Counter Project

## Objective

The objective of the Sheet Counter project is to develop a system capable of accurately counting stacked sheets of paper using an Orange Pi, a camera, an AI model, and a display. The system aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for tasks that require precise sheet counting, such as inventory management, manufacturing processes, and quality control.

The key components of the project include:
- **Orange Pi**: A single-board computer that serves as the main processing unit.
- **Camera**: Captures images of the stacked sheets.
- **AI Model**: A pre-trained model in TensorFlow Lite format that processes the images and counts the sheets.
- **Display**: Shows the count results and provides a user interface.

By integrating these components, the project seeks to automate the counting process, reduce human error, and improve overall efficiency in various applications.
